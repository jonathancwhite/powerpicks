# Powerpicks.io

This is a branch off of powerpicks.io create by Jermeh (github.com/jermeh). I decided to do my own version/branch off of it so that I can get more familiar the MERN stack rather than using a CMS to handle the content. Is this the most optimal solutions? Probably not, but it will work.

## Purpose

This build will serve as a central hub for all pickems that take place within our friend group and will hold all data/reporting and history of leagues so we can have better historic data and statistics
